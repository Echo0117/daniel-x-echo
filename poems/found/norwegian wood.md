Opening

Let me take your heart,
hold it gently in my hands,
and try to melt it slowly,
to see if, within you,
I still shine in flawless beauty.

Doubts and longing

Do you still think of me,
thread by thread, unbroken?
Do you still love me,
unable to pull yourself away?
In your heart, is there a secret place
that I have never reached?

Forest imagery

There, the lake is always clear,
the air forever calm.
The white moonlight falls upon the earth,
hiding memories you refuse to bring up.

Love and solitude

You once said true love can begin again,
and it can endure.
But why do your eyes still carry
loneliness and desolation?
Am I only a shelter,
filling the hollow in your feelings?
When will that forest in your heart
allow me to stay?

Hidden secrets

The lake remains clear,
the air filled with silence.
The moonlight unveils the land,
concealing the deepest secret within you.

Confession

Perhaps I should not ask,
disturbing the stillness of your heart.
Yet my love overflows its bounds,
I long to possess everything of you.

Restraint

Perhaps I should not ask,
nor make you revisit the past.
But the shackles in my heartâ€”
how can they ever be released?
