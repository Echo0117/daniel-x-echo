每日清晨都会升起无法抑制的冲动，
思念你，
想要去思念你，
好像有了如此深的起心动念，
便可以填满你不在身旁的空洞。

像被拨动的琴弦，
声声如泣，动人心魄，又不过是无助地颤栗，
到不了彼岸，
也走不出这座城。

日日徘徊在两个极端，
有你在心中便足够，
山海也无法阻隔；
无你在身旁太煎熬，
分秒都度日如年。

这世界那么苍凉，
我们如此渺茫；
这世界那么缤纷，
我们如此鲜活。

我不理解如此短暂的生命，
我为什么没有抓紧时间去见你；
我们恪守本分，
我们小心翼翼，
我们用掉生命在大洋两岸徘徊，
不去奔赴。

我厌倦自己的怯懦，
被冠以理性之名。
鼓吹的勇敢和不顾一切，
加上了先决条件。

我想要的，
从始至终都只有你。
群山无棱，
天地合衾，
也无法放开你。

你敲开我的心门，
走进来。
一路从春夏，走到金秋。
你埋下的种子已深深扎根我心底，
生根发芽，
再无路回头。

朝颜晨放，
满天星风起；
夕颜昼落，
曼珠沙华绯红。
从朝生到暮死，
至此不渝。


Every morning an urge rises I cannot still—
to miss you,
to choose the missing,
as if such a deep stirring of the heart
could fill the hollow of your absence.

A string once touched keeps trembling—
notes like quiet weeping, piercingly soft—
yet they cannot reach the far shore,
nor lead me out of this city of longing.

Daily I sway between two poles:
With you in my heart, it is enough—
mountains lie down, oceans forget their width;
Without you by my side, the waiting sears—
each second stretches, lasts a year.

The world can be wind-bleached and vast,
and we, so small;
the world can burst with color,
and we, so vividly alive.

I do not understand, why in such a fleeting life, 
I did not seize every moment to see you.
We kept our stations,
we tiptoed the thin ice,
spent our days pacing opposite shores,
and would not set out.

I am tired of my caution
wearing Reason as a crown.
The bravery I preached, the recklessness I praised—
Each came with clauses.

What I have desired,
from the very beginning to the very end, is only you.
Even if ridgelines wear to dust,
even if heaven and earth entwine as one,
I could never let you go.

You knocked upon my heart,
and stepped inside.
Through spring and summer, into golden autumn,
the seed you planted has taken root,
grown deep and unyielding,
with no path back.

Morning glory opens at first light;
Baby's-breath scatters in the wind;
Moonflower fades with the day,
Lycoris radiata burns crimson.
From life’s first light to its final dusk,
My vow does not waver.
