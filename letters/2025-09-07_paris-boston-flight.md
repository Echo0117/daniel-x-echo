我最亲爱的Daniel，

第一次不能陪你一起坐飞机，写封信陪你，希望八个小时的飞行不会那么孤单。可是我好像不知道要怎么写这封信，不知道要怎么不把眼泪落在信纸上，就像我不知道要怎么度过接下来没有你的两个月，要怎么一个人睡觉，辗转反侧的夜里翻身却握不到你的手，看不见你的脸，听不见你的呼吸。

八十天而已，可以爱一个人爱得如此之深吗?可是你是如此得独一无二，比太阳更耀眼，如月光更皎洁，谁又能不爱上你呢?我很感激所有的细节都准确无误地发生了，让我们能够相遇，也感激你让我看见真爱的模样，如此精致脆弱，所谓彩云易散琉璃脆，但是同时又无比强大，赋予人直教生死相许的勇气，填平山海的力量。

我知道你就是我的终点站了，从见到你照片的时候，便有了众里寻他千百度，蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处的感觉。如果不是你，那也没有人能再胜过巫山和苍海，请一定要平安，我愿意用自己的一切换你未来七十年的平平安安。

未来突然变得如此清晰起来，每一帧的画面都是你的样子，那些虚幻的名词，幸福，快乐，温暖，安全突然有了具体的模样，全部都映着你的影子。每一天我都诧异于人类怎么可以如此疯狂得爱着一个人，而每一天我都震惊于这份爱竟又比昨天更浓烈，就像是已经如此无垠的宇宙竟还在每时每刻地膨胀，毫无尽头。

爱会有尽头吗?我无法想象怎样才能停止爱你，世界末日?天启轮回?好像都不足够，我开始理解了古时的殉情和牺牲。如果没有你，绚丽缤纷的世界定会瞬间褪成灰白，没有光亮无比苦寒，一秒钟都会是煎熬。可是又会想，爱上过你，被
你爱过，就已经是永恒了，死亡又算是什么呢，我们所有的回忆好像也足够支撑彼此走过一段很长的孤独旅程了。

何况只是异地而已，我可以无时无刻地感受到你爱着我，隔着山海，也能共同创造许多新的回忆，数着马上能见到的日子，每一天也一定都会更期待，因为会距离你越来越近，一步一步地走向我的，我们的星辰大海。

你接下来的几周可能会比较难熬，请一定要打电话给我，无论何时你感受到你需要我。几点都可以，在哪里都可以，你永远可以没有愧疚地麻烦我，就像是巡航的船永远可以随时回港。无论和Adam的谈话进行得怎么样，我们一定可
以找到解决办法，无论有没有学位，你最终想要的生活也一定都能实现。我和你好像在一起成长，一起学着少讨好别人一些。未来还有无数的可能性，只要是和你在一起，什么样的生活都是我向往的生活!

等我。我一定会好好照顾自己，去见你。请你，也一定一定，要平安，要快乐!

My dearest Daniel,

For the first time I can’t fly with you, so I’m sending this letter to keep you company. I hope the eight hours in the air won’t feel so lonely. And yet I hardly know how to write it—how to keep my tears from the page, just as I don’t know how to pass the next two months without you: how to sleep alone, to turn over in the restless night and find no hand to hold, no face to see, no breath to hear.

Eighty days—can you love someone this deeply in so short a time? But you are utterly unique: brighter than the sun, clearer than moonlight—who could help but love you? I’m grateful that every detail unfolded exactly as it did so we could meet, and grateful that you showed me the shape of true love—so fine and fragile: bright clouds unweave with ease; glass yields at the lightest touch—and yet so powerful it gives one the courage to pledge life and death, the strength to level mountains and cross seas.

I know you are my journey’s end. From the moment I saw your photo, it felt like this: a thousand searches through the crowd; I turn—and find you waiting where the lanterns ebb to dusk. If it isn’t you, then no one could ever outshine the vast sea and the clouds of Wu—after the vast sea, other waters fail; beyond the clouds of Wu, no cloud is truly cloud. Please, be safe. I would give everything of mine for your next seventy years of peace.

The future has suddenly become so clear; every frame holds your face. Those airy nouns—happiness, joy, warmth, safety—now have a concrete form, all cast in your light. Each day I’m astonished that a human heart can love so wildly; each day I’m amazed that this love is even stronger than yesterday—like a universe already without bounds and still expanding, moment by moment, with no end.

Does love ever end? I cannot imagine how I would stop loving you. Doomsday? The Apocalypse? Samsara’s turning wheel? None of it seems enough. I begin to understand the old vows and sacrifices. Without you, the vivid world would drain to gray—lightless, bitter cold—and every second would be an ordeal. And yet I think: to have loved you and been loved by you is already eternity. What is death then? Our memories could carry each of us a very long way through any lonely passage.

And after all, it is only distance. I can feel your love at every moment. Across mountains and seas we can still make new memories. Counting down the days until I see you, I will look forward more with each sunrise, because each day brings me closer—step by step—toward our own sea of stars.

The next few weeks may be hard. Please call me whenever you need me—any hour, any place. You never have to feel guilty for leaning on me, the way a ship at sea may always return to harbor. However your conversation with Adam goes, we will find a way. Degree or no degree, the life you want will be yours. It feels like we are growing together, learning to please others a little less. The future holds countless possibilities; so long as I’m with you, any of them is the life I long for.

Wait for me. I will take good care of myself and come to you. And you—please, please—be safe, and be happy.

Echo
