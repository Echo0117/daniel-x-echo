Letter from miss you too much so can't sleep Echo - 09/09/2025 night

Dear Daniel,

I miss you too much, didn’t wanna go to sleep, kinda wanna keep the melancholic feeling of missing you for a while before I sleep, so I still feel your presence in my heart, so I am writing to you now.

I just went through our WhatsApp chat from the very beginning, how we were describing our ideal relationship, how we were still using she/he, how we were trying to be really polite, the urge to get close, and still the very restrained sense of distance. Now in my mind, all the he/she became you/me; and all the you/me became “us”. Everything we were saying earlier, we are doing it gradually, step by step, building the fresh, uncorrupted private world together. Each passing day, the world gets more cozy and vivid. We don’t even need to be physically together to do that. But still, I very much would like to hold you, touch you, and kiss you, like a sunflower that can't help but crave the sun.

I didn’t know that I’d miss you this much. It’s only been two days, why it felt like an eternity. Right now, I feel going out, chilling, party don’t interest me at all anymore, all I want is to work harder, so I can be with you sooner. You became not just the motivation, but the objective as well. I have been rehearsing countless times in my mind how to talk to my supervisors, how to arrange my schedule, how to fly to Boston, it became the only thing that i want to do the most.

You are right, that the most difficult part in our long-distance relationship is just that we can not hold, touch, and kiss each other. All the other security, interests, and loyalty issues are such ridiculous things to worry about. I feel i’d be willing to give up the whole world for you, i can’t imagine if there is even anything existing for me to give up on you.

I hope I can sort out everything faster, so I can come to see you, or i hope i can just be more careless and just do it; I still don’t understand why I'm doing variational inference now instead of doing you. I’ve never wished time could pass faster, way faster, so I get to meet you again.

Please take care of yourself; seeing you sick really hurts me. I really wish I could be there with you, take care of you, and give you a massage to relieve the pain. Please don’t push yourself too hard, we want a happy, healthy, robust, and fcable Daniel!!

I love you. Have a good day and night!
