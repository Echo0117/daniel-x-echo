我最亲爱的Daniel，

希望旅途顺利，你正安逸地坐在家里，读我的信。已经好几天没有见了，我可以想象我正在无比思念你，从相识起，就没有再与你分开过，应该已经八十天了吧。多长啊。又多短呀。可是只要想起这将是未来与你一起度过的漫长一生里，不经意的两个月，就又充满了欢喜，因为还有那么多个两个月、两年，十年，就无比期待。

我似乎从未没有如此确信过一段感情。如此认准过一个人，不需要去假没任何的如果，不需要去怀疑任何的细节，我们看见彼此的灵魂，交出仍滚烫的赤诚，让两颗心贴得如此之近，暴露出令人胆颤的脆弱，却不再害怕，只收获温暖和心疼的拥抱。我开始感激我受过的所有伤害，它们为我浇铸出铠甲，也为我擦亮了双眼，让我能在遇见你的时刻便看到你的美好，并将铠甲下我的真心，完好如初地交给你，并将一个人的铠甲重铸成两个人的保护盾，抵御未来的一切风雨，共同前行。

我喜欢和你一起在和煦春风里漫步，也喜欢和你在温暖夏日里小憩，虽还未与你走过四季，但我能想象秋日的栗子香，冬日的寒梅艳，我们一起在星空下许下了要举案齐眉，白首借老，要相守一世，上天既然听到我的愿望将你送来我身边，那他一定送来了那流星，让你伴我终老。

你的出现带来了光。照耀大地的光，那些我们曾经在追求的金钱。名望。成功。那些萤萤烛火在璀璨夺目的太阳面前不值一提。我突然明白了深爱一个人的含义，随着相处的时间越来越长，我愿意为你放弃的东西也越来越多。爱情，除了在于我愿为你付出的，也在于我愿为你割舍的，甚至不求任何回报，因为你的存在就已经如此美好，你的幸福已让我足够欢喜，我想要在你身边，就好像我想要在阳光下在空气里，在淡水中，我没有办法再回到没有你的日子，就像黑暗里的人本可以忍受黑暗，如果他们不曾见过流光溢彩。

我满心期待地重塑了我的生命，我准备好为你收拾出一座心房，以及大片的空间如大段的时间，让你能够完整地进驻进来，我也开始期待生命的每一天，每一次见到的你的笑颜，每一次听到的你的心跳，每一次嗅到的你的呼吸，每一次触到的你的脸庞，每一刻所感受到的与你的当下。

甚至即将要开始的异地也不那么难以受，或许还有些兴奋，那又会是怎样一种生活呢?有你在我心里却不在身边，想见你便会跨越万里去看你，我们会再一起踏遍万里河山。我们会分享各自的生活，填补彼此未能在身旁的缺失，而那时光又会反过来滋养爱情。因为我们又彼此独立去经历了生命，各自成长，产生新的碰撞。你会成为我内在的能量，让我坚不可摧，又柔软无比。

我想要和你有一座靠近自然的房子，三只狗，一些孩子，有的像你，有的像我，有一辆你喜欢的车，可以修建你喜欢的地下室，做很多有趣的实验，然后看着孩子们逐渐长大，有他们自己喜欢的人生，我们再一起变老，细数回忆。

人生多有意思啊，一切都是循环，我们幼年时听父母说起简单的心愿，逐渐长大，我们开始反叛，想要更大的成就，直到我们遇到一个人，儿时听到的父母的心愿又成了我们的心愿，我们再讲给自己的孩子听，如此循环往复，生生不息。如此美好，又如此简单。人类啊，如此多样，又如此相似。

我好想要一直写下去，那么今日就一直不结束，我也不必与你分开，但是又想快点到与你分开的日子，因为只有走过那里，才能走到永远与你在一起的新生活。我真的好爱你，你要平安喜乐，等我走到你身边来，再不分离。

My dearest Daniel,

I hope your trip goes smoothly, and that by the time these words reach you, you are resting comfortably at home, reading my letter. It’s been days since we last met; I can feel how fiercely I miss you. Since the day we found each other we’ve scarcely been apart—what is it now, eighty days? So long, and yet so short. And when I remember that in the long life we’ll share, two months is only a blink, my heart fills with joy—for there will be so many more: months, years, decades. I can hardly wait.

I have never been so sure of a love, so certain of a person. I need invent no “ifs,” and I doubt no detail. We have seen each other’s souls and offered up our still-warm honesty; two hearts pressed so close that every trembling tenderness lies bare—and yet we are unafraid. There is only warmth, and embraces that ache with care. I have even begun to be grateful for every hurt I once carried; they forged my armor and cleared my sight, so that when I met you I could see your goodness at once, lift my true heart intact from beneath that armor and place it in your hands—and then recast the armor of one into the shield of two, to face whatever weather comes, walking forward together.

I love strolling with you in the mild winds of spring, and dozing beside you in the gentleness of summer. Though we have not yet walked the full circle of the seasons, I can already smell autumn’s chestnuts and see winter’s bright plum blossoms. Beneath the stars we vowed to honor one another as equals, to grow old side by side, to keep a lifetime’s watch. Since Heaven heard my wish and sent you to me, surely it also sent that falling star, so you might keep me company all my days.

You brought light—the kind that bathes the earth. The wealth, the fame, the victories we once chased are only fireflies and candleflames before the dazzling sun. I suddenly understand what it means to love deeply: as time goes on, I find myself willing to set aside more and more for you. Love is not only what I’ll give, but what I’m glad to give up—even without asking anything in return—because your very existence is already so good, and your happiness is joy enough for me. I want to be by your side the way I want sunlight, and air, and fresh water. I cannot go back to the days without you, just as someone living in the dark might have endured it—until they have seen light shimmer once.

With glad expectation I’ve reshaped my life. I’m ready to make you a room in my heart, and to clear wide spaces and long stretches of time, so you can move all the way in. I’ve begun to look forward to every day: each time I see your smile, hear your heartbeat, catch the breath you breathe, feel your face beneath my fingers—each present moment with you.

Even the distance soon to come feels bearable—almost thrilling. What kind of life will it be, with you in my heart though not at my side? When I long for you, I will cross a thousand miles to find you, and we will roam the world again. We will share our days and fill the spaces absence leaves; and time, in turn, will nourish our love, because we will each live and grow, bringing new sparks when we meet again. You will be the power within me—unyielding, and yet infinitely gentle.

I want a house near nature with you, three dogs, and a handful of children—some like you, some like me—a car you love, and a basement you can shape as you wish for all kinds of curious experiments. We’ll watch the children grow into the lives they love, and then we’ll grow old together, counting our memories.

Life is so wondrous: everything moves in circles. As children we heard our parents’ simple wishes; as we grew we rebelled and chased grander triumphs—until we met someone, and the wishes of our parents became our own, and we passed them on to our children, again and again, without end. So beautiful, and so simple. Humanity—so various, and so alike.

I want to keep writing forever; then today would never end and I would not have to part from you. And yet I want the day of parting to come quickly, because only by passing through it can we arrive at the new life where I am with you—always. I love you so much. Be safe and joyful. Wait for me to come to you, and then let us never part again.
